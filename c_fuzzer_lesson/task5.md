## 5. Loop Task

## Instructions:
Write a for loop that iterates through a range of numbers and prints each number.
Write a while loop that prints numbers from 0 to 4.
Modify the loops to print the number along with the iteration count.

## Example:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Using a for loop
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
    }

    // Using a while loop
    int count = 0;
    while (count < 5) {
        printf("Count is %d\n", count);
        count++;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
