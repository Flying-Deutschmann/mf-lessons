# mf-lessons
## Introduction
This repo is to store the learning support material for open source lessons I create.
At this stage no runners have been provisioned, or test environment created.

## Local Requirements
- Git installed.
- A text editor.
- A can do attitude or something lame like that.

## Project Structure
Project directories created from the project root are to be appropriately named, and contain at a minimum:
- A README file containing lesson/s technical scope.
- Configuration requirments for develop environment.
- Practical labs and instructions meaningfully broken into separate directories.
- No programs or large files are to be stored in this project.
